## Before reporting
 - Search for the bug on the issue tracker. Make sure to look at closed issues too!
-->

## Useful information to include:
 - Minecraft version
 - CC: Tweaked version
 - Plethora version
 - Detailed reproduction steps: sometimes I can spot a bug pretty easily, but often it's much more obscure. The more information I have to help reproduce it, the quicker it'll get fixed.
