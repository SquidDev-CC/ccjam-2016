				<!-- I think the second sentance is a little redundant.  Also "allows wrapping" doesn't flow well.
				A better sentance might be "ComputerCraft computers may wrap almost any tile entity with Plethora"
				-->
				Plethora allows wrapping almost every tile entity as a peripheral. With integration with a wide range of
				mods, Plethora allows you to interact with the world in new ways.

				You might want to explain a bit more what modules are, before describing what they do.
				Something like "Plethora adds items caled Modules.  Modules expose additional functionality to computers.  For example, the block scanner allows a non-command computer to retrieve information about surrounding blocks."
				-->
				Modules expose additional functionality to computers, such as the block scanner which will tell you all
				about the nearby blocks or the introspection module which allows computers to interface with the
				player's inventory.

				If you've ever wanted to embed a computer in your skull then this is the mod for you! The neural
				interface combines the portability of a pocket computer and the power of modules, allowing you to
				directly interact with the player wearing it.

				Yeah. You can put it on animals too. Combine this with the kinetic augment module and you can control
				the animal however you want. Skeleton army? Check. Remote control creepers? Check. Your enemies will
				tremble before your terrifying programming skills.

				<!-- I would list more than two modules here; probably change the picture to something displaying more than just the image -->
				Amongst the other modules included are entity scanners and laser guns. Combine the two and you've got a
				pretty nifty little mob defense system right there.

				Yep. I bet you didn't even know you wanted this until you read it.
